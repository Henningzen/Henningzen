## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Henning, software engineer/developer and experienced systems architect.

> ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating and implementing the **NeTEx** and **SIRI** standards for public transport data exchange. My focus is on developing robust solutions that leverage these standards to enhance the core business of my employer Norled AS for marine public transport.

(NeTEx : "Network Timetable Exchange", SIRI : "Service Interface for Real-time Information" are standards under the [European CEN Technical Committee 278](https://www.cencenelec.eu/areas-of-work/cen-sectors/transport-and-packaging-cen/intelligent-transport-systems/) for Intelligent Transport Systems.)

- ðŸ’» I'm an advocate of Functional Programming as a way to express complex concepts in simple models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning for artificial intelligence: neural networks, and reinforcement learning.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m investigating NeTEx and SIRI standards for Public Transportation in a SciCloj environment.
- ðŸ’° I have a professional career as an expert polyglot programmer; Clojure, Java, C# and Python, with Kafka, Datomic et al.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Clojure, Emacs and fly-fishing.
- âš¡ I'm in my 9th year as full time linux desktop user.
