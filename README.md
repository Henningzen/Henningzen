## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Henning, software engineer/developer and experienced systems architect.

> ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating and implementing the **NeTEx** (Network Timetable Exchange) and **SIRI** (Service Interface for Real-time Information) standards for public transport data exchange. These standards are managed by the **CEN Technical Committee 278** and are crucial for enabling seamless, real-time information sharing across different transport systems. My focus is on developing robust solutions that leverage these standards to enhance the core business of my employer Norled AS for marine public transport.
